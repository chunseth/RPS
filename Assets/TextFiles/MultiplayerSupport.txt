Massive Scale RPS Architecture (100+ Concurrent Matches)
1. Distributed Server Architecture
Replace Single Server with Server Fleet:
Service
2. Lightweight Match Instances
Eliminate Heavy 3D Arenas:
}
3. Client-Side Rendering with Server Authority
Hybrid Architecture:
Server: Pure game logic, gesture validation, anti-cheat
Client: All rendering, UI, audio, visual effects
}
4. Optimized Network Protocol
Custom Lightweight Protocol:
}
5. Stateless Match Management
No Persistent GameObjects:
}
6. Memory and Performance Optimization
Object Pooling at Scale:
}
7. Gesture Detection Optimization
Reduce Hand Tracking Overhead:
}
8. Database and Persistence
Fast Data Layer:
}
9. Monitoring and Auto-Scaling
Real-time Performance Monitoring:
}
10. Technical Specifications for Scale
Performance Targets:
1000+ concurrent matches per server
<50ms gesture validation latency
<1MB memory per active match
<100KB/sec bandwidth per match
Server Architecture:
cluster
Cost Optimization:
Spot instances for match servers (save 70%)
CDN for static assets (gesture models)
Regional server deployment
Auto-scale based on player count
11. Implementation Strategy
Phase 1: Proof of Concept (10 matches)
Build lightweight match system
Test gesture detection optimization
Measure performance baseline
Phase 2: Scale Testing (100 matches)
Implement object pooling
Add performance monitoring
Load test with bots
Phase 3: Production (1000+ matches)
Deploy server fleet
Add auto-scaling
Regional optimization
This architecture can theoretically support 10,000+ concurrent matches across a server fleet while maintaining the responsive VR experience. The key is shifting from Unity's GameObject-heavy approach to a lightweight, data-driven system optimized specifically for the simple logic of Rock Paper Scissors.
