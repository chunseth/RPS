1. Design Game Logic and Rules
Define game phases (lobby → countdown → play → reveal → results)
Establish win conditions and scoring system
Design round structure (best of 3, best of 5, etc.)
Plan tie-breaking mechanics
Create game state machine architecture
2. Hand Gesture Recognition System
Analyze XR Hands joint data to identify rock/paper/scissors poses
Create gesture detection algorithms using finger positions and rotations
Implement confidence thresholds for gesture recognition
Add gesture validation to prevent false positives
Create visual debugging tools for gesture detection
3. Networked Game Manager
Extend existing mini-game framework for RPS gameplay
Create player matchmaking system (2-player focused)
Implement game session management and state synchronization
Handle player disconnections and reconnections gracefully
Integrate with existing lobby and authentication systems
4. VR User Interface Design
Design 3D lobby interface for game selection and matchmaking
Create countdown timer visualization in VR space
Design score display and leaderboard integration
Build results screen showing both players' choices
Add "Play Again" and "Return to Lobby" options
5. Gesture Visualization System
Create 3D representations of rock/paper/scissors gestures
Show real-time gesture preview for local player
Display opponent's final choice after reveal
Add visual feedback for successful gesture detection
Implement gesture confirmation indicators
6. Complete Game Flow Implementation
Build seamless transition between game phases
Implement countdown synchronization across players
Create simultaneous reveal mechanism
Handle result calculation and display
Add rematch functionality and session management
7. Network Synchronization
Ensure perfectly synchronized countdown timers
Implement secure gesture submission system
Prevent cheating through early gesture detection
Handle network latency compensation
Create robust state validation across clients
8. Audio and Feedback Systems
Add countdown audio cues ("3, 2, 1, Shoot!")
Create gesture detection confirmation sounds
Implement win/lose/tie audio feedback
Add ambient game atmosphere sounds
Integrate with existing audio mixer system
9. Mini-Game Framework Integration
Adapt RPS game to work with existing MiniGameBase class
Integrate with scoreboard and player management systems
Add to mini-game selection menu
Ensure compatibility with existing network infrastructure
Create RPS-specific onboarding tutorial video
10. Testing and Optimization
Test hand tracking accuracy across different hand sizes
Optimize for VR performance (90fps requirement)
Handle edge cases (partial gestures, hand occlusion)
Test network synchronization under various latency conditions
Validate gameplay balance and user experience
Additional Considerations:
Accessibility: Support for players with limited hand mobility
Tutorial System: Integrate with existing tutorial framework
Analytics: Track game statistics and player engagement
Visual Polish: Particle effects, animations, and VR-specific UI polish
Localization: Multi-language support for international players
