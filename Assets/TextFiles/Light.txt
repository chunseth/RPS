MVP Build Strategy - Phase 1: Core Foundation
Step 1: Scene Setup (30 minutes)
Start with a completely empty scene and add only the essential networking infrastructure:
Drag in the NetworkManager_VR_Multiplayer_Template prefab
Add the XR Interaction Setup (MP Variant) prefab for VR functionality
Place a simple ground plane and basic lighting
Add two spawn points 2 meters apart facing each other
No fancy arenas, no UI, no audio - just the bare minimum to get two VR players connected
Step 2: Data-Only Match System (2 hours)
Create the lightweight match architecture without any GameObjects:
Build a simple RPS_MatchData struct that holds player IDs, round states, and scores
Create an RPS_MatchManager script that manages pure data (no MonoBehaviour components)
Implement a basic state machine: Waiting → Countdown → Playing → Results → Waiting
Store matches in a simple dictionary - each match is just data, not objects in the scene
Step 3: Minimal Gesture Detection (1 hour)
Implement the simplest possible hand tracking:
Use the existing XR Hands data from your template
Create basic gesture recognition using finger curl values only
Three states: Fist (Rock), Open Hand (Paper), Two Fingers (Scissors)
No complex algorithms, no confidence thresholds - just simple position checks
Only detect gestures during the "shoot" moment, not continuously
Step 4: Basic Networking (1 hour)
Leverage your existing networking but keep it minimal:
Use Unity's built-in RPCs for gesture submission
Send only essential data: player ID, gesture type, timestamp
Implement simple server authority - host validates all gestures and determines winners
No anti-cheat, no lag compensation - just basic networked communication
Step 5: Text-Only UI (30 minutes)
Create the absolute minimum interface using simple TextMeshPro components:
One floating text showing countdown: "3... 2... 1... SHOOT!"
One text showing current round: "Round 1 of 3"
One text showing scores: "Player 1: 0 | Player 2: 1"
One text showing results: "Rock beats Scissors - Player 1 Wins!"
All UI floats in world space, no fancy positioning or animations
Step 6: Two-Player Matchmaking (30 minutes)
Implement the simplest possible player pairing:
When a player joins, add them to a waiting queue
When two players are in queue, instantly create a match between them
No lobby selection, no room browsing - just automatic pairing
Players are automatically teleported to the spawn points when matched
MVP Testing Strategy
Test 1: Single Machine (Day 1)
Use ParrelSync or MPPM to run two Unity editor instances
Verify two VR players can connect and see each other
Test basic gesture detection without networking
Confirm UI displays correctly in VR space
Test 2: Local Network (Day 2)
Test on two separate VR headsets on same WiFi
Verify gesture data transmits correctly between clients
Test complete Bo3 match flow from start to finish
Measure basic performance metrics (framerate, latency)
Test 3: Internet Connection (Day 3)
Test between headsets on different networks using Unity Relay
Verify networking remains stable with real internet latency
Test edge cases: disconnections, rejoining, simultaneous gestures
MVP Success Criteria
Core Functionality
Two players can join automatically and be matched together
Both players see synchronized countdown timer
Hand gestures are detected reliably for Rock, Paper, Scissors
Winner determination works correctly for all 9 possible combinations
Bo3 scoring tracks properly (first to win 2 rounds wins match)
Players can play multiple matches in sequence
Performance Targets
Maintains 72+ FPS in VR throughout entire match
Gesture detection latency under 100ms
Network sync keeps countdown within 50ms between players
Match uses less than 10MB memory total
Can support 5+ concurrent matches on single host
User Experience
Match takes 60-90 seconds total (including countdown and results)
Gesture detection feels responsive and accurate
Results are clearly communicated to both players
No confusing states or broken game flow
What to Deliberately Exclude from MVP
Visual Polish
No 3D gesture previews or fancy visual effects
No arena environments or decorative elements
No particle effects, animations, or transitions
No custom materials, shaders, or lighting effects
Audio System
No countdown audio cues or sound effects
No victory/defeat sounds or ambient audio
No voice chat integration during matches
Advanced Features
No spectator mode or match replay
No player statistics tracking or leaderboards
No tournament brackets or ranking systems
No customizable avatars or player profiles
Optimization
No object pooling or memory management
No LOD systems or performance scaling
No regional server selection or load balancing
Development Timeline
Day 1: Foundation - Scene setup, basic networking, simple UI
Day 2: Core Logic - Match system, gesture detection, game flow
Day 3: Testing - Bug fixes, basic optimization, multi-device testing
Day 4: Polish - UI improvements, better gesture tuning, edge case handling
This MVP approach gets you to a playable Rock Paper Scissors game in 4 days while establishing the lightweight architecture needed for massive scaling later. Once this works reliably with 2 players, you can incrementally add more matches, better UI, and eventually scale to hundreds of concurrent games.
